🛠️ Ansible Overview
Ansible is a open-source automation tools it is used to configuration management and application deployment and tasks automations is called Ansible.

📘 Core Components
📄 Playbook
A Playbook is a YAML file that easy to read and write in ansible that contains the list of the tasks to be executed on one or more target machines.
It is used for automating complex tasks like installing software, restarting services, copying files, etc.
Playbooks can manage multiple servers at the same time.

🧱 Module
A Module is a pre-defined unit of work in Ansible.
Each task in a playbook uses a module.

⚡ Ad-hoc Commands
Ad-hoc commands are one-line Ansible commands used to perform quick tasks without writing a full playbook.

📂 Inventory
Inventory is a file in Ansible that contains a list of target machines (hosts or servers) where Ansible will run the tasks.

🗂️ Hosts File
The hosts file (also called the inventory file) is used to define the target systems that Ansible will manage.

🧩 Role
Role is a way to organize your Ansible code in a clean and reusable structure.
It is used to break big playbooks into small, reusable components.
Each role contains its own tasks, handlers, variables, files, templates, etc.

🔁 Handler
Handler is a special type of task in Ansible that runs only when notified.
Handlers are used to perform actions like restarting a service, after configuration file changes.

🔧 Task
A Task is a single unit of work in Ansible.
Each task performs one specific action, like installing a package, copying a file, starting a service, etc.

🚀 Other Concepts
💥 GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD automation tool provided by GitHub.
It allows you to automate workflows directly within your GitHub repository.
With GitHub Actions, you can build, test, and deploy code automatically in response to events like code pushes, pull requests, releases, or scheduled times.

🔐 Become (Privilege Escalation)
It allows to Ansible to execute the tasks with sudo privilege which is necessary when performing the actions like installing packages, copy the files, restarting services, etc.

♻️ Idempotency
Idempotency means that running the same task of multiple times will always produce the same result,
and it does not make changes if the system is already in the desired state.
