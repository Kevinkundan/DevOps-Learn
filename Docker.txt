🐳 Docker Full Notes (Formatted)

1. Docker
   Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment and scaling in your application using the containerized technology. It is called Docker.


2. Dockerfile
   Dockerfile is a script that contains the instructions for building the Docker images.

3.  Docker Image
    Docker image is a read-only binary template that contains the instructions for creating a Docker container.


4. Docker Container
   Container holds the entire package that needs to run your application, including runtime system tools, system libraries. We can call it like a virtual machine.


5. Docker Hub
   Docker Hub is a cloud-based repository service that allows users to upload and download your images in private and public environments.


6. Docker Networking
  1.  Bridge Network
      Containers are connected to the default bridge network and can communicate with each other.

      Bridge network gets its own private IP address like 172.16.0.0/17.

      Types:
       1. Default – It is automatically created when Docker is installed. DNS is not supported.

       2. Custom – Manually created by the user. It offers more flexibility and better isolation compared to default. DNS is supported.

2. Host Network
   The container shares the host network stack. No isolation between container and host network.

3.  Overlay
    Designed for Docker Swarm. Connects multiple Docker daemons to enable communication between Docker Swarm services.

4.  MacVLAN
    It assigns a MAC address to each container.

5.  None
    The container has no network. Ideal when you want complete isolation between container and host network.


7.  Dockerfile Instructions
  1. RUN – Used to execute the command during the build process (e.g., install packages and dependencies).

  2. CMD – A default command to run when the container is started.

  3. ENTRYPOINT – Used to specify a fixed command that always runs when the container starts. Any additional arguments passed to the container will be passed to the entrypoint.

  4. COPY – Used to copy the files and directories from the build context into the image.

  5. ADD – Similar to COPY but with extra features. It can download files from a URL and extract tar archives.


8.  Container Runtime
    Container runtime is a software component responsible for running containers on the host system. It is used to start, stop, and manage containers.


9. Docker Engine
   Docker Engine is the core component that enables to you run, build, and manage containers on a host machine.

10. Docker Compose
   It is a tool used to define and run multi-container of Docker applications.
   It allows you to manage multiple Docker containers using a single YAML configuration file (docker-compose.yml).


11. .dockerignore file- it is used to specify files and directories that should be (ignored) when building a Docker image. 

     This helps in:

       1. Improving build content

       2. Reducing the image size



13.  Docker Volume
     A Docker Volume is a persistent storage used by Docker containers to store and share data.
     Volume data is available even after the container is removed or restarted.


14.  Docker Daemon
     The Docker Daemon (dockerd) is the background service that:

     Manages all Docker containers Manages images, networks, and volumes

15. Multi-Stage Build
   Multi-stage build in Docker uses multiple FROM statements in one Dockerfile to separate the build environment from the final runtime environment.

✅ It helps to create smaller, cleaner, and more secure images by copying only the necessary build artifacts from the builder stage into the final image.
